                    <h3>Early Days</h3>
                    <p>When I was a kid I was a very unruly student. I changed schools three times before landing on my
                        final one in 6th Grade.</p>
                    <p>I took an IT technical course in there, that's where I started loving technology. Loving free
                        software came a year later. After that I studied for a year to pass university exams, and passed a
                        university entrance exam in 2023 for Computer Science.</p>
                    <h3>Free Software and Linux</h3>
                    <p>
                        My first contact with free software was when I was around 16 years old. I installed <a
                            href="https://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a> on my
                        external hard drive (cause I was too scared of installing for real). I liked it a lot, even though
                        back in 2018 the actual performance of Linux was abysmal. Nowadays I
                        use minimalistic distributions like <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> and <a
                            href="https://www.alpinelinux.org">Alpine Linux</a>, They work very well for my usage (gaming,
                        studying, making and finishing university assignments., etc). I want to try out <a class="yellow"
                            href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a> when I can, but for now my PC can't use <a
                            target="_blank" href="https://www.fsfla.org/ikiwiki/selibre/linux-libre/">Linux-Libre</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>Besides that? I like PCs, videogames, virtual reality, heavy metal, djent, I play the guitar, etc.
