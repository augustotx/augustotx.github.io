Alpine as Main Distro?

Maybe I'll try [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) as my main distro for a while, see if it holds up. I don't like how it doesn't have a native Steam package, but that's what [musl](https://musl.libc.org/) does to you. I tried using [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) with musl for a while, but it was a pain, so I don't know if it's going to be a smooth transition like I want it to be.
